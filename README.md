# Flame-Protector
I didn't have a lot of time to develop this game, so it seemed really simple. It was done in less than half a day. It is made for Pygame Community Spring Jam 2024.

You need to keep dragging different files to the game window to help the fire burn more brightly.  Otherwise, the temperature will gradually drop, causing you to lose the game.

This game doesn't actually delete your files, so you can take it easy.
